    <h1>Mental Disorders</h1>
      <h2>Neurodevelopmental</h2>
        <h3><em>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</em></h3>
        <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD may have problems with social communication and interaction and have restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. Symptoms include being distracted by other stimuli and avoiding eye contact. A majority of those with ASD respond best to highly structured and specialized programs.</p>
        <h3><em>Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</em></h3>
        <p>ADHD is usually first diagnosed in childhood and can last into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors, or be overly active. Treatments include medication like Ritalin/Adderall and therapy.</p>
      <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
        <h3><em>Schizophrenia</em></h3>
        <p>There are two types of schizophrenia: chronic (process) schizophrenia and acute (reactive) schizophrenia. Chronic schizophrenia develops gradually and recovery is doubtful, while acute schizophrenia develops suddenly due to a stressor and there is a greater chance of recovery. Psychosis, delusions, and hallucinations are common symptoms of schizophrenia. During a psychotic episode, one can experience irrationality, trouble identifying what is real, delusional thinking/speech, disturbed perceptions, and exaggerated emotions. Delusions are false beliefs often centered around persecution or grandeur, and hallucinations are sensory experiences without any sensory stimulation. Positive symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, disorganized speech, and inappropriate laughter/crying. Negative symptoms include toneless speech, less speaking, flat affect, mutism, and catatonia. Antipsychotics like Thorazine are used to treat schizophrenia.</p>
      <h2>Mood Disorders</h2>
        <h3><em>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) (PDD)</em></h3>
        <p>Major depressive disorder is when there are two or more weeks of depressed moods, feelings of worthlessness, and little interest in most activities. It is often a response to past or current events and involves anxiety and rumination. Persistent depressive disorder is when there is a mild depressed mood regularly for 2+ year. Symptoms include appetite/sleep regulation problems, low energy and self-esteem, difficulty concentrating/making decisions, and feelings of hopelessness. Both forms of depression can be treated with cognitive therapies, antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft, and SSRI's.</p>
        <h3><em>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</em></h3>
        <p>Seasonal affective disorder is related to seasonal changes and starts in fall and lasts throughout winter. Symptoms include diminished energy/mood, oversleeping, and increased appetite for carbohydrates. Light exposure therapy is a possible treatment option for SAD.</p>
        <h3><em>Bipolar Disorder</em></h3>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is associated with mood swings and is when one experiences both depression and mania. A manic episode often includes euphoria, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and irritation. This can be treated with lithium carbonate and Depakote.</p>
      <h2>Anxiety Disorders</h2>
        <h3><em>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder</em></h3>
        <p>Generalized anxiety disorder is when one continuously feels tense and apprehensive for no specific reason. Symptoms include difficulties in concentration, twitching, and fidgeting. Panic disorder describes anxiety that escalates into episodes of intense dread, or panic attacks. Symptoms of a panic attack are heart palpitations, shortness of breath, trembling, and dizziness. These can be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), stress inoculation training, and antianxiety drugs like Xanax and Librium.</p>
       <h3><em>Phobia and Social Anxiety Disorder</em></h3>
       <p>A phobia is an irrational fear of a specific object, activity, or situation. Most have specific triggers and can entail panic attacks as well. Some examples of phobias include agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder, or social phobia. Phobias can be treated with exposure therapy, counter-conditioning, systematic desensitization, flooding, and aversive conditioning.</p>
